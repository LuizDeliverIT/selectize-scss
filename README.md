Selectize-SCSS
===============

[Selectize.js](https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js) is a great jQuery-plugin for displaying custom `<select>`-elements. Unfortunately it relies on LESS as a CSS-precompiler.

As I personally rely on SCSS and I also want to be able to configure the design of Selectize.js by using variables, I made a port to SCSS. But beware: at the moment there's only the Default-theme available!

If you need the Bootstrap-2/3-theme ported to SCSS, maybe you'd like to contribute and make a pull-request.

1. Just fork this repository
2. Checkout a new branch
3. Write the Bootstrap-2/3-styles and make the pull-request.

Thank you!
